# CS-self-learing
In this repository, I will keep a record of my cs self-learning procedure. Some parts of it will be more like a studying diary. Some will provide a link to other repositories which carry bunches of files I download and implement from some famous foreign courses. Of course these are more than showing off, you may use this as self-studying reference!
